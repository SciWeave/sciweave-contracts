# SciWeave

SciWeave is a modular stack for architecting DeSci DAOs and a base layer of DAOs, researchers, investors.   

DAO members contribute research papers to the DAO, which are encrypted and uploaded to Filecoin via the gateway. A token is attached to each upload, and other parties can buy access to the research from the DAO. Then upon successful payment they get a token, which they must present to the gateway to assert that they have the rights to get the research. The DAO then unlocks it.   

The smart contracts also contain options for funding research via the DAO. Anyone can contribute in any supported token. Investors can later on vote on the research and decide if it was successful.   

Anyone can query the base layer and build frontends on top of it.   
i.e. the investor SBTs will prove how much and into what someone invested --> a AngelList FE can be built for it
i.e. FE software tool that enables DAO members to collaborate on science, vote etc.
